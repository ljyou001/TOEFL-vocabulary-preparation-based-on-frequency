times || female || professor || hard || work || shows || unfortunately…it || week || late || male || student || know || sorry || got || little || behind || know || sports || homework… || top || things || female || professor || glad || hear || meeting || today… || like || talk || creative || writing || students || one-on-one || least || term || see || male || student || think || ok. || busy || know || that…female || professor || well || found || years || assignments || pretty || tough || first || year || students || like || like || response || paper || explication || pablo || neruda || poem || uh || way || choose || lemon || an… || unusual || choice || male || student || favorite || book || neruda || poems || poems || everyday || objects || know || simple || pleasures || female || professor || right || elemental || odes || one || favorites || male || student || liked || neruda || took || things || like || fruit || vegetables || socks || used || metaphors || similes || describe ||

|| complete || second || part || time || considering || much || time || first || part || took || male || student || actually || finished || came || female || professor || excellent || male || student || tricky || know || write || poem || inspired || lemon || completely || different || style || female || professor || right || male || student || order || really || study || neruda || style || read ||

meet || told || phone || 're || looking || part-time || position || yeah || roommate || works || dining || hall || heard || part-time || job || might || opening || new || semester || hoping || one || got || filled || couple || days || ago || oh || really || thing || 've || got || ta || something || pay || expenses || well || i-i || 'm || afraid || hard || work || guess || y'see || always || check || class || schedules || potential || applicants || make || sure || 're || full-time || students || good || standing || schedule || past || semester || mean || everything || computer || science || african || history || zoology || physics || manage || heavy || class || load || pretty || well || actually || get || job || course || may || cut || back || normal || schedule || y'know || many || great || subjects || learn || ah || generalist || yeah || 's || gon || na || hard || pick || one || thing || specialize || say || gives || idea || uh || 're || pretty || comfortable || computer || right || learning || new || software || applications || sure || 'm || pretty || good || well || last || week || got || call || folks || visualization || project || want || add || couple || part-timers || staff || visualization || project || yes || help || professors || different || departments || turn || information || something || students || see || know || instead || writing || blackboard || professors || want || project || information || onto || screen || say || professors || really || good || subject || areas || comes || computers || well || get || picture || use || visualization || project || create || like || graphs || different || sorts || right || graphs || economic || trends || instance || population || growth || sometimes || dynamic || maps- || maps || change || screen || show || instance || trade || ebbed || flowed || centuries || along || various || routes || china || mediterranean || wow || 'd || interesting || yeah || 's || classroom || lectures || project || staffer || might || also || asked || help || professors || put || together || research || data || model || visually || claim || putting || research || map || example || moving || image || helps || see || connections || new || relationships || data || say || animal || migration || patterns || might || miss || 're || looking || numbers || piece || paper || 's || terrific || uh || working || hours || 're || pretty || flexible || staffers || go || work || day || night || make || sure || 's || done || time || professor || needs || shall || give || number || call || get || touch || people || oh ||

two || navigation || systems- || one || long || trips || one || short || trips || well || speculate || think || mole || rats || rely || first || system- || using || underground || landmarks || sense || time- || well || make || small || mistakes || short || trip || n't || matter || much || trip || short || ca || n't || make || many || mistakes || long || trip || well || lots || opportunities ||

'll || thanks || narrator || listen || part || lecture || art || history || class || male || professor || alright || last || week || started || talking || painters || sculptors || part || art || movement || called || dada || n't || want || think || ideas || introduced || last || time || limited || painting || sculpture || sorta || thing || today || want || move || beyond || visual || arts || talk || bit || dada || performing || arts || theater || let || 's || start || reviewing || dada || ok || 'll || recall || dada || began || switzerland || city || zurich || 1916. || artists || started || reacting || traditional || notions || uh—of || beauty || reason || progress || standards || western || thought || since || eighteenth || century || looked || around || well || mean || first || world || war || raging || n't || see || much || beauty || reason || progress || world || instead || saw || world || chaotic || random || world || n't || make || sense || 's || way || world || well || wanted || art || reflect || let's-let || 's || review || couple || key || ideas || backbone || dada || art || first || dadaists || wanted || completely || reject || classical || idea || art || classical || ideas || like || proportion || balance || things || think || think || great || art || `` || great || art || '' || involved || reason || logic || beauty || dadaists || wanted || overthrow || uh || well || y'know || to—to || dadaist || classical || artwork || reflection || outdated || thinking || 's || dadaists || created || sculptures || like || ones || saw || last || week || remember || stool || bicycle || wheel || mounted || top || would || n't || exactly || call || beautiful || would || course || n't || meant || point || ok || another || key || dada || idea || talked || embracing || randomness || right || uh || life || random || said || dadaists || would || make || art || order || logic || collage || looked || artist || took || different || y'know || cut-out || squares || colored || paper || threw || onto || canvas || wherever || landed || composition || work || another || favorite || dadaists || something || called || chance || poetry || chance || poet || would || pull || words || hat || would || well || would || make || the—the || poem || idea || chance || randomness || key || element || dadaism || whole || world || seemed || random || let || 's || take || look || dadaist || ideas || presented || audiences || highly || unconventional || well || even || sure || categorize || theatrical || events || suppose || 'd || call || shows || shows || started || zurich || place || called || cabaret || voltaire || rejection || classical || western || art—well || see || nature || took || place || cabaret || voltaire || n't || put || plays || operas || throw || conventions || mixed || everything || anything || together || would || might || start || somebody || reading || poem || somebody || else || playing || instrument || followed || display ||

|| garbage || especially || true || solid || organic || waste || food || scraps || home || food-processing || plants || waste || farms || sort || thing || know || two-thirds || waste || sitting || landfills || organic || material || government || recycling || programs || materials || like || plastic || glass || metal || yet || widespread || solutions || organic || waste || materials || really || addressed || united || states || think || asking || trouble || future || today || want || talk || technology || offers || potential || solution || problem—anaerobic || phased || solids || digestion || aps || digestion || first || anaerobic || mean || ah || anyone || female || student || without || oxygen || male || professor || correct || aps || digestion || uses || anaerobic || bacteria—ones || thrive || absence || oxygen—to || consume… || break || organic || material || male || student || excuse || professor || um || anaerobic || bacteria || 're || talking || well || n't || anaerobic || bacteria || also || used || wastewater || treatment || plants || male || professor || yes || fact || would || like || explain || class || male || student || sure || wastewater || treated || one || byproducts || thick || liquid || called || sludge—and || anaerobic || bacteria || used || break || sludge || male || professor || right || anaerobic || bacteria || used || wastewater || treatment || decades || male || student || technology || different || male || professor || good || question || um || anaerobic || digestion || systems || used || wastewater || plants || designed || treat || sludge || solids || past || researchers || attempted || treat || solid || organic || waste || equipment || always || problem || order || process || solid || waste || th-the || kind || find || landfills || pretreat || solids || turn || sludge—first || breaking || material || apart || mechanically || small || particles || adding || lot || water || got || kind || thick || soupy || mix || equipment || could || handle || extra || step || took || time || required || lot || energy || female || student || sounds || like || would || cost || lot || male || professor || 's || right || aps || digestion || designed || specifically || handle || solid || waste || much || cost-effective || new || technology || processes || organic || waste || two || phases || remember || aps || stands || anaerobic ||

|| electricity || saves || lot || money || ultimately || decreases || need || fuels || like || petroleum || coal || expensive || also || polluting || male || student || organic || waste || landfills || could || processed || way || male || professor || 's || certainly || one || possibility || aps || digestion || systems || versatile || installed || anywhere || see || anaerobic || digestion || systems || used || wastewater || treatment || plants || huge || tanks || hold || thousands || gallons || wastewater || aps || containers || small || enough || set || on-site || waste || generated ||

surprised || mean || first || time || read || anyway || male || professor || surprised || female || student || know || seemed || like || nothing || going || story || mean || girl || sitting || beach || thinking || one || memories || …and…at || time… || watching || bathers || beach || …and || sort || thinking || happens || end || story || thought || slight || incredulity || male || professor || know || mean || uh || 's || um || surprise || ending || like || o. || henry || 's || story || `` || gift || magi || '' || big || adventure || like || faulkner || bear || …so || n't || like || story || female || student || well || actually || reading || second || time || sort || realized || n't || need || surprises || excitement || great || story || girl || 's || memory || stuffs || thinking || watching || people || beach || really || interesting || read || know || it-it || made || think || write || story || one || write || class || could || maybe || use || memories || get || started || male || professor || well || fact || hoped || see || uh || course || many || levels || story || really || wanted || class || take || away || need || write || great || exciting || world || write || stories || um || even || writing || memory || work || female || student || like || could || write || one || times || took || walk || woods || kid || male || professor || exactly || know || due || date || stories || approaches || uh || 'm || hearing || lot || students || 're || worried || n't || anything || `` || exciting || enough || '' || write || welty || said || interview || listened ||

|| big || shift || but… || think || important || understand || pack || much || life || vibrancy || excitement || painting || bowl || fruit || something || dynamic || know || still || lifes || need ||

elements || still-life || paintings || example || portrait || might || map || hanging || wall || might || books || table || next || subject || objects || tell || something || subject || like || uh || maybe || person || well- || educated || big || part || still-life || painting || use || kinds || symbols || objects || include || provide || context || help || convey || message || also || like ||

make || sure || class || presentations || next || week || order || coming || along || well || know || 're || supposed || report || area || recent || research || genetics-something || know…original || male || student || well || think || 've || found || thing || actually || occurred || couple || nights || ago || eating || dinner || cafeteria…tell || professor…do || like || broccoli || female ||

|| never || liked || it-or || vegetables || matter || brussels || sprouts || asparagus || cauliflower-you || name || taste || bitter || and…well || nasty || mother || always || called || picky ||

|| actually || makes || possible || people || taste || bitterness || certain || green || vegetables || people || mutation || gene || taste || bitterness || female || professor || mulling || well || s…certainly || fascinating…but…so || biologist || basically || claiming || people || like || eat || vegetables || actually || sort || sensory || deficit || humorously || sorta || makes || us || picky || eaters || normal || ones || mean || 's || kinda || turning || things || head || n't || male || student || matter-of-factly || snidely || well || first || time || would || think || way…humans ||

narrator || listen || part || lecture || environmental || science || class || female || professor || today || going || begin || discussing || ecosystems || one || important || point || wan || na ||

|| instrument || know || today || result || continuing || development || started || practical || purposes || 1920s || long || even || people || experimenting || ways || modify || traditional ||

presented || articles || let || start || play-as-preparation || hypothesis || jerry || explain || male || student || yeah || play || preparation || young || animals || play || order || get || really || good || certain || specific || things || need || adults || things || like || chasing || pouncing || climbing || words || play || order || practice || survival || skills || like || movements || used || hunting || fighting || hypothesis || makes || lot || sense || like || maybe || sense || theories || read || female || professor || leads || conclusion || male || student || well || like || wolves… || young || pups || fight || lot || bite… || know || hurt || seems || obvious || wolf || pups || play || like || that— || gives || em || practice || skills || make || em || better || hunters || fighters || adults || female || student || oh || know || mean || things || young || animal || playing || totally || different || things || adult || really || good || example || second || article— || remember || called || exactly—uh || self-…female || professor || self-handicapping || female || student || right…self-handicapping || like || fake || fight || uh || play || fight— || one || animals || winning || winning || animal || might || stop || give || advantage || female || professor || yes || often || shifts || submissive || posture || course || self-handicapping || hardly || ever || happens || real || fight— || real || fight— || well || point || win || self-handicapping… || important || take || account || deciding || go || first || explanation || fact || really || much || way || solid || experimental || evidence || support || play-as-preparation || hypothesis || female || student || one || flexibility || hypothesis || female || professor || ah || yes || let || talk || say || play || much || pretend || fighting || practicing || adult || behaviors || apparently || also || contributes || development || brain || flexible || brain || quickly || able || get || handle || unfamiliar || situations— || notion || flexibility || hypothesis || well || many || colleagues || find || quite || persuasive || female || student || like || kids || little || kid || might || play || game || friend || might || race || across || field…so || switching || one || type || play || another… || lot || variety || mean || re-they || learning || respond || whatever || happens || female || professor || well || general || idea || let || hold || talking || human || behaviors || ok. || according || flexibility || hypothesis—yes—the || diversity || variety || play || lead || broader || behavioral || vocabulary || male || student || broader || behavioral || vocabulary || explain || means || female || professor || well || sometimes || playing || results || animal || something || would || normally || lead || animal || learning || adapt… || come || new || behaviors || help || cope || major || problems || later || like || staying || safe || finding || food || female || student || yeah || brain || study || us || read || female || professor || oh || one || play || affects || development || within || brain || female || student || right || it… || uh || animals || raised || environment || get || opportunities || play || female || professor || yes || conclusion || interesting || playing || literally || stimulates || growth || creates || connections || within || brain || need || studies || …male || student || uh || excuse || go || back || play || fighting || minute || wondering || flexibility || hypothesis || really || explain || female || professor || play || fighting || actually || something || flexibility || hypothesis || explains || well || since || play || fighting || includes || variations || speed || intensity || quick || role || reversals || involved || self-handicapping || animal || play || fighting || constantly || responding || changes || learning || flexible || narrator || listen || conversation || student || director || student || activities || center || female

|| folktales || since || illustrate || variety || pretty || well || general || three || main || types || norwegian || folktales || one || animal || stories || animals || main || characters || wild || animals || uh || domestic || lot || times || talk || behave || like || humans || time || retain || animal || characteristics || tend || involve || animals || like || bears || wolves || foxes || point || stories || internal || objective || speak || usually || explain || feature || animal || arose || 's || one || fox || fools || bear || going || ice || fishing || tail || bear || puts || tail || water || hole || ice || try || catch || fish || ice || freezes || around || ends || pulling || tail || 's || bears || day || short || tails || second || category || norwegian || folktale || supernatural || uh || stories || giants || dragons || trolls || humans || supernatural || powers || gifts || like || invisibility || cloaks || people || turned || animals || back || person || called || transformation || stories || 's || well-known || norwegian || supernatural || folktale || transformation || story || called || `` || east || sun || west || moon || '' || 'll || read || involves || prince || 's || white || bear || night || human || day || lives || castle || 's || east || sun || west || moon- || heroine || story || try || find || besides || good || example || transformation || story || one || also || lot || common || things || tend || show || folktales || 'll || find || standard || opening || `` || upon || time || '' || stock || characters || like || prince || poor || beautiful || peasant || girl || 's || heroine || mentioned || um || conventional || form || two || characters || involved || one || scene || happy || ending || 's || story || presented || though || well || even || though || lot || actions || occur || pretty || fantastic || 'd || never || think || realistic || characters || still || act || like || resemble || real || people || 're || real || even || based || historical || figures-but || might || supernatural || story || involving || king || 'd || act || like || 'd || expect || norwegian || king || act || ok || third || main || kind || folktale || comical || story || 'll || say || later || aware || category || contain || supernatural || aspects || 're || usually || playful || amusing || overall || supernatural || stories || said || traditionally || folktales || passed || orally || generation || storytellers || style || telling || story || um || norway || nineteenth || century || folktales || kids || n't || seen || worthy || analysis || academic || attention || changed || romantic || movement || spread || throughout || europe || mid-nineteenth || century || romantics || looked || folktales || sort || reflection || soul || people || something || distinctly || norwegian || folktales || norway || renewed || pride || literature || art || forms || individual || countries || result || first || collection || norwegian || folktales || published || 1852. || 've || many || new || editions || published || since || people || norway || stories || important || part || means || norwegian || narrator || listen || part || lecture || biology || class || female || professor || james || said || 've || state || maine || right || male || student || yeah || actually || lived || western || maine || till || 16. || female || professor || great || n't || tell || everybody || 's || like || winter || male || student || chuckling || winter || well || 's || cold || 's || lots || snow || would || n't || believe || much || snow || used || get || female || professor || actually || would || field || research || couple || winters || really || incredible || environment || survive || sort || environment || animals || adapt || evolve || response || surroundings || 'll || recall || adaptation || feature- || uh || physical || behavioral || feature-of || species || helps || survive || reproduce || adapting || extreme || climates-like || maine || wintertime- || animals || evolve || pretty || interesting || ways || take || example || snowshoe || hare || ok || snowshoe || hare-and || course || 's || spell || word || '' || h-a-r-e || '' || like || rabbit || though || probably || mention || technically || hare || exactly || rabbit || even || though || similar || primary || difference || rabbit || 's || young || born || blind || without || fur || hare || 's || babies || born || full || coat || able || see || pause || snowshoe || hare || tell || sort || adaptations || think || 's || developed || help || survive || maine || winters || 'll || give || hint || food || n't || issue || hare || actually || abundant || food || small || twigs || finds || male || student || well || n't || know || mean || know || used || try || look || rabbits || uh || hares || went || hiking || winter || often || hard || find || snow || female || professor || yes || 's || exactly || right || major || concern || snowshoe || hare || winter || predators || includes || humans || one || adaptations || basically || camouflage || words || coat- || fur-turns || brown || summer || white || winter || makes || harder || hare || 's || predators || see || white || snow || male || student || yeah || could || swear || remember || seeing || rabbits || snow || couple || times || mean || hares || brown || female || professor || well || may || well || timing || really || important || snowshoe || hare || n't || always || get || exactly || right || chances || survival || best || turns || white || time || first || snowfall || 's || amount || daylight || triggers || changing || hare || 's || coat || days || get || shorter-that || sun || shorter || shorter || time || day- || snowshoe || hare || starts || growing || white || fur || shedding || brown || fur || hare || pretty || good || job || timing || sometimes-when || 's || really || early || late || snow-it || stands || plus || takes || month || snowshoe || hare || 's || coat || completely || change || color || 's || particularly || early || snowfall || 's || likely || hare || 's || fur || would || yet || totally || white || would || make || particularly || dangerous || time || hare || pause || ok || else || adaptations || susan || female || student || well || 's || called || snowshoe || hare || feet || somehow || protected || cold || female || professor || well || animal || 's || name || adaptation || feet || though || like || warm || furry || boots || something || keep || feet || getting || cold || 've || probably || never || needed || wear || snowshoes || well || snowshoes || like || thick || furry || shoes || designed || keep || feet || warm || 're || actually || quite || thin || wide || spread || weight || foot || coming || snow || see || problem || walking || snow || sink || every || step || snowshoes || n't || sink || walk || top || snow || makes || walking || maine || countryside || winter || much || easier || anyway || snowshoe || hare || adaptation || plays || idea- || hind || feet || act || like || snowshoes || mean || paws || wide || allow || hare || hop || run || surface || deep || snow || huge || advantage || snowshoe || hare || since || contrast || feet || predators || usually || sink || right || snow || another || advantage || related || unlike || many || animals || winter || snowshoe || hares || stay || lean || lightweight- || accumulate || essentially || body || fat || anyone || guess || female || student || n't || eat || much || well || yes || n't || enough || food || around || 's || like || said || food || almost || always || within || reach || n't || store || lot || food || energy || harsh || winters || narrator || listen || part || conversation || student || biology || professor || male || professor || assignment || reproduce || one || animal || camouflage || experiments || read || text || book || experiment || pick || female || student || well || wondering || could || try || reproduce || experiment || kinda || opposite || discussed || textbook || male || professor || instead || animal || might || hide || want || something || animal || might || want || seen || hmmm || tell || female || student || well || got || idea || one || journals || said || look || at…it || experiment || um || upspeak || called || eyespots || article || -male || professor || eyespots || sure || patterns || wings || moths || butterflies || generally || believed || scare || predators || look || like || big || eyes || female || student || yeah || except || article || experiment || disputes || theory || male || professor || well || know || markings || scare || birds || idea || spots || look || like || eyes || well || commonly || held || belief || female || student || even || based || research || male || professor || well || whole || idea || moth || butterfly || markings || scary || look || like || eyes || rests || imagine || predators || like || birds || perceive || markings || never || really || know || observe || bird || behavior || tell || experiment || female || student || ok || experiment || looked || shapes || markings || moth || wings || researchers || wanted || know || markings || round || eye-shaped || effective || deterring || predators || square || rectangular || markings || male || professor || ok…female || student || yeah || attached || food || paper || models || moths || different || shaped || marks || drawn || wings || see || birds || reacted || interesting || realized || round || marks || effective || scaring || birds || shapes || male || professor || less || effective || -female || student || researchers || determine || larger || markings || effective || smaller || markings || scaring || prey || called || phenomenon || visual || aliveness || male || professor || visual || aliveness || huh || well || guess || shocking || think || female || student || anyway || ok || repeat || experiment || write || male || professor || yes || think || work || problem || foresee || well || urban || campus || hard || time || finding || good || place || set || experiment || female || student || oh || i-i || planning || campus || going || home || spring || break || family || lives || country || far || nearest || city || set || backyard || male || professor || good || idea || except || one || week || lot || time || need || make || adjustments || enough || data || set || experiment || near || bird || feeder || get || much || observation || time || narrator || listen || conversation || student || professor || male || student || hi || professor || anderson || really || interesting || lecture || class || today || female || professor || thanks || tom || yeah || animals || use || deception… || ways || play || tricks || animals || 's || fascinating || area || one || 're || really || starting || understand || male || student || yeah || know || selective || adaptations || time || one || thing || oh || like || uh || nonpoisonous || butterflies || come || look || like || poisonous || ones || idea || animals || species || intentionally || deceive || 'd || never || heard || female || professor || right || like || thinking || another || example || uh || like-there || male || frogs || lower || voices || end || sounding || bigger || really || male || student || uttered || statement || question || keep || frogs || invading || territory || female || professor || right || bigger || frogs || deeper || voices || smaller || frog || imitate || deep || voice || well || male || student || yeah || see || might || trick || uh || anyway || wanted || ask || started || talking || game || theory || well || know || little || bit || 'm || clear || use || biology || female || professor || yeah || 's || fairly || new || biology || basically || uses || math || predict || individual || certain || circumstances || example- || brief || pause || thinking || example || business || sells || oh || computers || say || want || sell || computers || big || university || 's || another || company || bidding || male || student || continuing || line || thought || venturing || guess || well || try || offer || lowest || price || compete || still || make || money || female || professor || right || 're || competing-like || game || like || frogs || 're || risks || pricing || high || company || might || get || sale || 's || also || number || type || computers || consider || company || find || balance || costs || benefits || well || game || theory || creates || mathematical || models || analyze || different || conditions || like || predict || outcomes || male || student || ok || i-i || get || apply || animals || female || professor || well || know || 're || interested || topic || would || perfect || term || paper || male || student || unenthusiastically || literature || review || female || professor || yeah || find || three || journal || articles || another || topic || interests || discuss || 's || conflict || conclusions || something || 'd || important || discuss || male || student || pessimistic || think || well || 've || looked || dealing || game || theory || ca || n't || say || understand || much || statistics || end || female || professor || well || point || present || fairly || basic || studies || n't || assume || much || background || knowledge || 'll || need || answer || specific || questions || researchers || hypothesis || want || find || conduct || research || conclusions || came || learning || interpret || statistics || come || later || narrator || listen || part || lecture || linguistics || class || female || professor || right || far || 've || looking || core || areas || linguistics || like || syntax || phonology || semantics || um || things || study || looking || one || language || time || sounds || words || sentences || work || given || language || branch || historical || linguistics || involves || comparison || several || different || languages || comparison || different || stages || single || language || 're || comparing || different || languages || notice || lot || common || maybe || similar || sounds || words || correspond || one || another- || meaning- || sound || similar || let || 's || use || real-world || example || eighteenth || century || scholars || studied || ancient || languages || sanskrit || latin || greek || noticed || three || languages || many || similarities || might || several || reasons || languages || much || common || maybe || happened || chance || maybe || one || language || heavily || influenced || um || borrowed || words || maybe || maybe || languages || developed || source || language || long || ago || maybe || 're || genetically || related || happened || sanskrit || latin || greek || languages || many || similarities || concluded ||

|| showing || family || genetically || related || languages || instead || people || tree || model || language || family || starts || one || language || call || `` || mother || '' || language || example || proto-indo-european || mother || language || line || top || diagram || time || branches || new || daughter || languages. || branch || daughter || languages || languages || source || mother || called || sisters || share || lots || characteristics || went || 're || looking || big || upside-down || tree || languages || like || 's || incomplete || course-just || give || idea || 's || family || tree || model || basically || tree || model || convenient || way || representing || development || language || family || showing || closely || related || two || languages || 's || obviously ||

|| spanish || 's || spoken || mexico || example || another || issue || languages || evolve || gradually || tree || model || makes || look || like || evolve || overnight || like || distinct || moment || time || mother || language || cleanly || broke || daughter || languages || seems || probably || n't || quite || like || narrator || listen || part || lecture || astronomy || class || male ||

|| anybody || else || huh || many || n't || strange || milkyway || galaxy || planet || earth || us || never || seen || 's || problem || female || student || light || pollution || right || streetlights || stuff || male || professor || yes || especially || unshielded || streetlights || know || ones || n't || pointed || downward || 's || irony || building || 're || astronomy || building || far ||

|| anywhere || near || city || mean || uh || 've || lived || around || whole || life || 've || never || seen || milky || way || within || city || limits- || probably || never || 's || price ||

ok || let || 's || look || way || n't || get || information || looking || stars || past || 70 || years || 've || also || used || radio || astronomy || lets || us || study || radio || waves || sky || male || student || observe || radio || waves || mean || tell || anything || stars || male || professor || well || optical || astronomy-using || telescope || observing || stars || way- || rely ||

hours || narrator || listen || part || discussion || art || history || class || male || professor || right || let || 's || continue || discussion || portrait || artists || portraiture || remembers || uh || important || points || made || last || time || sandra || female || student || um || well || artists || done || portraits || people || centuries || famous || people || regular || people || ah || portraits || convey || artist's-uh || personal || vision || like || feelings || insights || person || male || professor || great || 's || crucial || point || 'd || like || explore || little || today || great || example || that-that || vision || portraiture || cecilia || beaux || cecilia || beaux || born || 1855 || learning || paint || studying || several || important || artists || time || beaux || became || known || one || best || portrait || painters || united || states || successful-she || even || portraits || wife || children || theodore || roosevelt || president || n't || get || much || prestigious || portraits || also || reflect || kind || subjects || beaux || tended || use || mostly || women || children || example || first || major || work || subjects || uh || painting || featured || sister || nephew || yes || mark || male || student || yeah || seems || interesting || um || wondering || unusual || portrait || artist || woman || become || well || known || successful || nineteenth || century || male || professor || great || question || yeah || really || stood || back || eighteen-hundreds || today || 's || still || considered || one || greatest || portrait || painters || time || male || female || admiring || excited || fact || first || full-time || female || instructor || pennsylvania || academy || fine || arts || full || member || national || academy || design || pretty || important || institutions || yeah || definitely || made || headway || women || artists || ok || let || 's || look || one || portraits || painting || called || dreamer || 's || one || favorites || think || 's || especially || characteristic || beaux || 's || work || see || portrait || close || friend || cecilia || beaux || 's || tell || 's || first || thing || draws || painting || catches || eye || first || female || student || well || 's || face || hands || think || 're || really || expressive || also || make || woman || seem || contemplative || seems || like || 's || thinking || pretty || seriously || something || male || student || yeah || eyes || kind || draw || strikes || contrasting || colors || the-the || white || dress || dark || background || kinda || reminds || painting || discussed || weeks || ago || um || uh || john || singer || sargent || think || called || madame || male || professor || agree || good || point || yes || beaux || high || regard || sargent || 's || work || something || technique || 'll || find || work || ok || painting || called || `` || dreamer. || `` || see || 's || dream-like || female || student || upspeak || unsure || well || background || behind || woman-it || 's || pretty || vague || female || student || like || maybe || 's || 's || real || context || like || definite || surroundings || especially || compared || woman || since || 's || clear || well || defined || male || professor || yes || unclear || background || definitely || contributes || dreaminess || 's || meant || show || sense || isolation || think || woman || deep || daydream || really || aware || anything || else || painting || shows || insightful || cecilia || beaux || portrait || artist || besides || excellent || technical || skills—like || use || brush || strokes || color || make || impression—beaux || perspective || comes || portraits || reveal || interpretation || subject || state || mind || 's || likenesses || undefined || background || also || shows || cecilia || beaux || influenced || french || impressionists || believed-like || beaux- || personal || rather || conventional || approach || subject || matter || beaux || used ||

basic || terms || dark || spots || sun || surface || ancient || chinese || first || record || observations || sunspots || early || year || 165. || later || european || astronomers || wrote || sunspots || believe || spots || actually || sun || belief || time || heavenly || bodies… || sun || moon || stars || planets… || perfect… || without || flaws || blemishes || opinion || spots || actually || something || else… || like || shadows || planets || crossing || sun || face || thinking || european || astronomers || introduction || telescope || brings || us || old || friend || galileo || early || 1600s || based || observations || sunspots || galileo || proposed || new || hypothesis || pointed || shape || sunspots… || well || sunspots || circular || shadows || planets || would || circular || right || problem || prevailing || view || also || noticed || shape || sunspots || changed || seemed || move || across || sun || surface || maybe || particular || sunspot || sort || square || later || would || become || lopsided || later || something || else…so || another || problem || shadow || hypothesis… || shape || planet || change || galileo || proposed || sunspots || indeed || feature || sun || know || kind || feature || proposed || might || clouds || atmosphere || solar || atmosphere || especially || seemed || change || shape… || predicting || changes || least || nothing || galileo || could || figure || random || shape-changing || would || consistent || spots || clouds || next || couple || hundred || years || lot || hypotheses || tossed || around… || spots || mountains || holes ||

|| anyone || think || another || possible || reason || male || student || well || maybe || admired || sculptures || know || liked || way || looked || male || professor || yes || 's || one || gazda || 's || points || another || nowadays || reproduction || easy || easy || roman || times || copying || statues || required || lot || skill || time || effort || gazda || hypothesizes || copying || n't ||

spices || regarded || important || expensive || used || diplomacy— || gifts || heads || state || ambassadors || taste || diet || relatively || bland || compared || today || much || variety || uh || especially || aristocracy || tended || eat || lot || meat || um || always || looking || new || ways || prepare || it— || new || sauces || new || tastes || spices || came || good || point || mention || one || biggest || myths || spices || commonly || said || medieval || europeans || wanted || spices || cover || taste || spoiled || meat || really || true || anyone || worry || spoiled || meat || afford || spices || first || place || could || afford || spices || could || definitely || afford || fresh || meat || also || evidence || various || medieval || markets || employed || kind || police ||

narrator || listen || part || lecture || biology || class || female || professor || well || finally || looking || like || spring || arriving— || last || winter || snow || melting || away || days || close || today || thought || mention || uh || biological || event || part || transition || winter || spring… || something || go || outside || watch || patience || 's || small || creature || lives || area— || probably || seen || north || american || wood || frog…now || wood || frog || easy || spot || since || stays || pretty || close || ground || leaves || things || blends || really || well || background || see || worth || effort || something || unusual— || something || might || even || thought || possible…ok || north || american || wood || frog || live || broad || territory || range || found || northeastern || united || states || canada || alaska || even || inside || arctic || circle || frog || able || live || far || northbut || wherever || live || weather || starts || turn || cold || temperatures || start || drop || freezing || soon || frog || even || touches || ice || crystal || bit || frozen || ground || well || begins || freeze || pause || humorously || notices || look || student || face || yes || jimmy || look || bit || taken || aback…male || student || wait…you || mean || still || alive || freezes || solid || female || professor || well || almost || ice || forms || spaces || outside || cells || never || within || cell || male || student || but… || heart || beat || female || professor || n't || male || student || but—how || do…female || professor || thing || well || first || touch || ice || apparently || triggers || biological || response || inside || frog || first || starts || drawing || water || away || center || body || middle || part || frog || internal || organs—its || heart || lungs || liver— || start || getting || drier || drier || water || pulled || away || forming || puddle || around || organs || underneath || skin || puddle || water || starts || freeze || ok || frog || heart || still || beating || right || slower || slower || but… || last || hours || freezes || distributes || glucose—a || blood || sugar—throughout || body || circulatory || system || sort || acts || like || antifreeze…male || student || solution || antifreeze || like || put || car || winter || female || professor || hesitantly || well || tell || frogs || extra || glucose || makes || harder || water || inside || cells || freeze || cells || stay || slightly || wet— || enough || survive || winter || heart || stops || beating || altogether || male || student || laughs || know || really || know || uh || long || stay || way || female || professor || well || could || days || even || months— || winter || fact || um || see || heart || really || need || pumping || blood || frozen || male || student || just…i || guess || see || t— || know || clinically || dead || female || professor || well || amazing || thing || revives || pretty || amazing || months || without || heartbeat || springtime || comes || around || earth || starts || warm || suddenly || one || day—ping || pulse—followed || another || one || another || until—maybe || ten || twelve || hours || later || animal || fully || recovered || male || student || and—does || uh || thawing || process || kind || trigger || well || female || professor || well || sure || actually || peculiar || thing || even || though || sun || warming || frog || outside || insides || thaw || first— || heart || brain || everything || somehow || happens || way || every || spring || male || student || thaw || affect || like || life || span || female || professor || well || hmm || really || know || lot || long || wood || frog || normally || lives || probably || years || evidence || freezing || process || affects || longevity || impacts || though || studies || found || comes || reproduction || freezing || diminishes || mating || performance || males || frozen || thawed || course || seem || quite || vocal || move || slower—and || seem || harder || time || recognizing || potential || mate || male || frog || could || manage || go || freezing || cycle || probably || success || mating || narrator || listen || conversation || student || professor || female || professor || ok || let || see || right || reading || modern || stagings || shakespearean || classic || well || like || told || last || week || think || great || topic || paper || questioning || title || something || like || …male || student || really || sure || probably || something || like || twentieth-century || stagings || midsummer || night || dream || female || professor || yes || like || straightforward || point || research || going || male || student || well || came || talk || wondering || happened || copy || peter || brook || production || midsummer || night || dream || video || collection || looking || everywhere || and… || really || hard || time || tracking || female || professor || exist || male || student || huh || mean || collection || female || professor || mean || particular || production || never || filmed || recorded || male || student || oh || idea || read || production || like || influenced || every || production || play || came || assumed || filmed || videotaped || female || professor || oh || definitely || landmark || production || like || ran || week || either || never || filmed || film || lost || ironic || even || film || making || production || none || production || male || student || video || female || professor || well || think || important || twentieth-century || staging || midsummer || night || dream || right || male || student || write || brook || interpretation || play || see || production || female || professor || recording || mean || figure || influenced || productions || male || student || guess || enough || material || around || challenge || female || professor || true || think || writing || dramatic || arts… || theater || nature || theater || male || student || mean || live || performance || finished || …female || professor || unless || filmed || gone || mean || study || course || students || class || writing || productions || nineteenth || century…and || videos || know || one || challenges || people || study || theater || find || ways || talking || something || really || transient || something || sense || exist || narrator || listen || part || lecture || art || history || class || male || professor || good || morning || ready || continue || review || prehistoric || art || um || today || covering || upper || paleolithic || period—um || roughly || defining || period || 35,000 || 8,000 || b. || c. || um || lot || cave || drawings || seen || come || period || uh || also || talking || portable || works || art—uh || things || could || carried || around || place || place || one || example || sculpture || called || lady || hood || carved || ivory || probably || mammoth || tusk || age || bit || mystery || according || one || source || dates || um || 22,000 || b. || c. || sources || claim || dated || closer || 30,000 || b. || c. || um || amy || female || student || know || exact || date || this… || head || made || male || professor || fair || question || talking || prehistory || here—uh || obviously || artists || put || signature || date || anything || know || figure || carved || male || student || last || semester || took || archaeology || class || spent || lot || time || uh || studying || ways || date || things || one || technique || remember || um || using || location || object || date || like || deep || buried || male || professor || would || stratigraphy || stratigraphy || used || dating || portable || art || archaeologists || digging || site || make || careful || notes || stratum—which || layer || earth—they || find || things || know || general || rule || oldest || layers || lowest || level || works || site || touched || layers || intact || um || problem || dating || method || object || could || carried || around || used || several || generations || discarded || might || much || older || layer || even || site || found || uh || stratification || technique || gives || us || minimum || age || object || necessarily || true || age || uh || tom || archaeology || class || talk || radiocarbon || dating || male || student || yeah || um || uh || chemical || analysis || something || measuring || amount || radiocarbon || left || oh || organic || stuff || know || fast || radiocarbon || decays || figure || age || organic || material || male || professor || key || word || organic || art || made || organic || material || male || student || well || said || lady || hood || carved || ivory—that || organic || male || professor || absolutely || examples || female || student || well || cave || drawings || use || like || charcoal || maybe || colors || dyes || made || plants || male || professor || fortunately || a-at || least || time || turns || radiocarbon || dating || works || lot || prehistoric || art || uh || problem || um || technique || destroys || analyzes || ya-you || chip || bits || object || testing || obviously || reluctant || cases || apart || another || problem || date || tells || age || material—say || bone || tree—the || object || made || date || artist || actually || created || radiocarbon || dating || get || maximum || possible || age || object || could || younger || ok || um || let || say || scientific || analysis || produced || age || range || narrow || female || student || um || could || look || similar || styles || motifs || know || try || find || things || common || one || time || period || male || professor || time || see || similarities || pieces || art || assume || connection || time || place || possible || could || imposing || values || analysis || male || student || sorry || get || point || um || well || kinds || preconceived || ideas || artistic || styles || developed || example || lot || people || think || presence || details || demonstrates || work || done || sophisticated || artist || um || lack || details || suggests || primitive || style || trends || art || last || century || certainly || challenge || idea || get || wrong || though || um || analyzing || styles || prehistoric || artifacts || help || dating || need || careful || idea || um || artistic || development || occurs || straight || line || simple || complex || representations || female || student || saying || mean || get || feeling || like || legal || process || like || building || legal || case || pieces || evidence || closer || get || truth || male || professor || great || analogy || see || exact || date || sculpture || lady || hood || narrator || listen || part || lecture || environmental || science || class || male || professor || ok || 've || talking || theories || deal || effects || human || activity || climate || today || 'd || like || talk || little || bit || theories || explain || variations || climate || one || um || best || known || called || milankovitch || hypothesis || um || milankovitch || hypothesis || um || says || variations || earth || 's || movements || specifically || orbit || around || sun || variations || lead || differences || amount || solar || energy || reaches || earth || 's || differences || amount || energy || 's || reaching || earth || sun || 's || causes || variations || earth || 's || climate || okay || lot || people || think || earth || 's || orbit || around || sun || perfectly || circular || smooth || regular || um || say || way || hands || move || well-made || watch || n't || work || way || 're || probably || aware || earth || 's || orbit || around || sun || 's || shaped || like || perfect || circle || 's || oval || 's || elliptical || shape || orbit || n't || consistent || varies || time || period || 100,000 || years || sometimes || 's || little || circular || sometimes || 's || elliptical || earth || 's || orbit || elliptical || earth || actually || closer || sun || part || year || makes || earth || particular || northern || hemisphere || warmer || 's || important || well || planet || 's || glaciers || northern || hemisphere || gets || warm || glaciers || stop || forming || already || talked || affects || earth || 's || overall || temperature || second || movement || involved || hypothesis || axial || tilt || tilt || earth || 's || axis || imaginary || pole || runs || center || earth || depending || angle || tilts || seasons || less || severe-it || makes || winters || cooler || summers || warmer || or-what || might || say || 's || makes || summers || less || hot || importantly || winters || less || cold || ah || like || mentioned || also || stop || um || prevent || glaciers || forming || cause || melt || 's || third || movement || hypothesis || covers || called || precession || precession || basically || change || direction || earth || 's || axis || rotation || would || take || million || years || explain || even || basics || movement || precession || quite || complex || details || way || beyond || scope || 's || important || understand || three || movements || well || 're || cyclical || work || together || form || produce || complex || regular || variations || earth || 's || climate || lead || growth || decline || glaciers || milankovitch || first || proposed || theory || 1920s || many || colleagues || skeptical || milankovitch || n't || proof || actually || would || n't || evidence || support || hypothesis || 1970s || oceanographers || able || drill || deep || seafloor || collect || samples || samples || analyzed || geologists || samples || able || put || together || history || ocean || temperatures || going || back || hundreds || thousands || years || showed || earth || 's || climate || changed || pretty || much || way || milankovitch || 's || hypothesis || suggested || would || evidence || pretty || strong || support || milankovitch || hypothesis || 1980s || people || accepted || theory || um || however || late || 1980s || scientists || exploring || devils || hole || ah || basically || extensive || water-filled || cave || far || ocean || nevada || western || united || states || millions || years || groundwater || left || deposits || mineral || called || `` || calcite || '' || rock || within || devils || hole || studying || calcite || deposits || could || determine || climate || conditions || temperatures || last || half-million || years || well || devils || hole || findings || contradicted || ones || obtained || 1970s || basically || question || ages || one || samples || wrong || scientists || misunderstanding || significance ||

professor || discussing || ancient || egypt || female || professor || ok || one || challenges || faced || ancient || civilizations || like || egypt || timekeeping || calendars || grow || food || whole || cities || people || important || plant || crops || right || time || start || financial || obligations—rents || taxes—you || keep || track || often || pay || today || look || egyptians || addressed || problems || fact || ended || using || two || different || calendars || one || keep || track || natural || world || uh || agricultural || concerns || another || one || used || keep || track ||

crops || finally || time || year || would || arrive || valley || would || produce || crops || wheat || barley || fruit || ready || harvest || ok || important || ancient || egyptians || know || nile-based || seasons || would || occur—their || way || life || depended || upon || way || used || count || time || based || phases || moon—which || regularly || predictably || goes || cycle || starting || new || moon || full || moon || back || new || moon || cycle || used || determine || length || months || uh || one || lunar || cycle || one || egyptian || month || four || months || would || constitute || season || twelve || months || approximately || 354-day || year || 354-day || agricultural || calendar || designed || help || determine || uh || nile || would || inundate || land || well || course || complicated || average || amount || time || floodings || actually || 354 || days || mean || although || varies || average || clearly || longer || 354 || days || keep || shorter || calendar || step || actual || flooding || nile || well || astronomers || discovered || uh || certain || time || year || brightest || star || sirius || would || disappear—actually || hidden || glare ||

choir || nice || finally || meet || person || problems || with…female || student || noise || like || explained || phone || always || rehearsals || lincoln || auditorium—every || day || three || clock—and || always || worked || great || past || weeks || noise || total || nightmare || since || construction || started || next || door || science || hall…facilities || manager || oh || right || building || addition || new || laboratories || female || student || exactly || anyway || ever || since || started || working || noisy || barely || hear || sing || facilities || manager || let || alone || sing || female || student || forget || singing || mean || keep || windows || everything || bulldozers || get || going || mean || machines || loud || already || cut || short || two || rehearsals ||

|| mean || evenings || really || hard || seems || like || everyone || choir || already || plans || even || classes || night || facilities || manager || music || building || female || student || know || originally || booked || one || rehearsal || rooms || music || building || switched || jazz || ensemble || much || smaller || group—and || said || acoustics || sound || room || better || them—so || us || move || bigger || space || like || lincoln || auditorium || seemed || like || reasonable || idea || facilities || manager || now…female || student || noise… || suspicious || tone || know ||

|| building || fully || booked || mornings || afternoons || everything || need || quiet || space—and || piano || facilities || manager || worried || realize || piano || required || piano… || course ||

|| move || earlier || later || female || student || wish || could || say || another || time || would || ok || but… || know || is… || everybody || already || got || commitments… || whole || semester || 2:30 || 3:30 || would || probably || ok || think || could || go || much || outside || that…facilities || manager || well || check || tomorrow || morning || found || something || cautioning || might ||

|| rivers || behave || day || might || change || happened || female || student || maybe || kind || climate || shift || -male || professor || well…lots || climate || shifts || happened || since || male || student || change || worldwide || geographical || area || male || professor || well || cotter || speculated || rivers || changed || worldwide || prove || it… || evidence || one || north || american || mountain || chain || studies || gave || idea || rivers || started || change—he || hypothesized || spread || plant || life || earth || female || student || plant || life || 450 || million || years

|| mars || clear || evidence || meandering || rivers || evidence || vegetation || mars || think || narrator || listen || conversation || student || political || science || professor || male || student || 'm || sure || know || elected || student || government || year || female || professor || oh || congratulations || student || government || undergraduate || taught || lot || political || process || fact || experience || solved || problem || life—it || really || cemented || interest || becoming || political || scientist || male || student || cool || anyway || um || reason || came || 're || getting || ready || conduct || straw || poll || campus || know || hold || informal || vote || since || general || election || 's || couple || months || away || wan || na || get || feel || student || body || 's || political || leanings || like || students || planning || vote || political || party || people || identify || sorta || thing || female || professor || oh || sure || helped || students || run || straw || poll || years || ago || remembering || distaste || lotta || work || mostly || used || paper || ballots || stayed || night || counting || 'em || making || strong || suggestion || use ||

|| interested…female || professor || oh || 'm || flattered || john || schedule || 's || jammed || 'm || teaching || two || seminars || intro || course || finishing || research || slight || pause || uh || professor || klein || 's || new || department || plus || 's || whiz || computers || male || student || ok. || 'll || ask || female || professor || changing || topics || decided || topic || term || paper || yet || male || student || really || female || professor || write || straw || poll || since || paper || 's || due || till || election || could || include || results || maybe || compare || real || election || results || male || student || would || enough || mean || comparing || numbers || female || professor || well || 'd || need || provide || analysis || thinking—there || 's || couple || local || ballot || questions || year || know || referenda || voters || either || support || support || male || student || right || 's || one || whether || ban || smoking || restaurants || another || one || uh || think || 's || whether || spend || tax || dollars || new || sports || arena || city || female || professor || ok || 's || idea || regular || elections || vast || majority || voters ||

professor || student || female || professor || enthusiastically || jeff || glad || dropped || meaning || congratulate || class || leadership || award || male || student || thanks || professor || bronson || really || happy || get || little || surprised… || modestly || mean || many || people || nominated || female || professor || sincerely || warmly || well || know || award || well-deserved || today || male || student || needed || talk || medieval || history || test— || upspeak || know || one || scheduled || friday || afternoon || female || professor || yes || male || student || well || 's || trip || french || class || taking || 're || going || montreal || weekend || female || professor || keenly || interested || interrupting || male || student || montreal || 's || favorite || city || 'll || seeing || male || student || uh || 'm || sure || yet—the || reason || main || reason || wanted || go || rooming || french-speaking || students || there—you || know || get || chance || use || french…to || actually || talk || real || french || speakers || female || professor || sounds || like || great || opportunity || 's || test || male || student || yeah || but—well || thing || bus || leaves || right || middle || history || class || meets || friday… || —well…i || thinking… || maybe || could || take || test || different || day…like || monday || morning || office || hours || female || professor || ah… || monday || morning… || mmm… || would || be—wait || let || see || one || thing… || ah || ha… || okay || thought || so… || class || planning || take-home || exam || so… || could || take || test || along || you…let || see… || guess || could || come || class || friday || pick || test || —that || way || still || make || bus… || find || quiet || time || trip || complete || it… || and… || bring || class || wednesday || collecting || everyone || else || male || student || mmm… || trip… || well || guess || could…so || plan || take || books || 'n || stuff || female || professor || 'll || definitely || need || class || notes || 'm || giving || several || short || essay || questions-to || make || think || critically || points || 've || discussed || class || state || uh || state || defend || opinion || analyze || issues || speculate || things || might || turned || differently || see || n't || care || look || dates || kind || thing || want || synthesize || information || reflect || back || 've || read || discussed || form || ideas || repeat || points || textbook || make || sense || male || student || yeah || think || 're || looking || point || view || female || professor || 's || right || midterm || exam || showed || know || details || test || want || see || put || together || show || original || thinking || male || student || sounds || pretty || challenging || especially || trying || work || trip-but || yeah || think || female || professor || 'm || sure || male || student || thank || professor || bronson || female || professor || great || time || montreal || narrator || listen || part || lecture || biology || class || female || professor || ok || let || continue || discussion || animal || behavior || talking || decisions || animals || face || …complex || ones || animals || even || insects || carry || look || like || complex || decision-making || processes || question || mean || one || really || thinks || that—say || bee—goes || weighing || pros || cons || pollinating || flower || flower || animals || solve || complex || questions || questions || seem || require || decision || making || answer || propose || course || behavior || largely || matter || natural || selection || example || let || look || foraging || behavior || among || beavers || beavers || eat || plants || mostly || trees || also || use || trees || tree || branches || construct || homes || streams || lakes || forage || food || shelter || materials || leave || homes || go || land || main || predators || number || choices || made || foraging || example || uh || need || decide || kind || tree || cut || trees || higher || nutritional || value || others || better || building || material || good || um || aspen || trees || beavers || peel || bark || eat || also || use || branches || building || shelters || aspens || double || duty || ash || trees || beavers || use || ash || trees || constructionanother || decision || forage || food || go || daytime || hotter || outside || expend || energy || night || weather || cooler || predators || active || ok || two || important || issues—really || central || uh || important || ok || first || let || say || beaver || could || get || amount || wood || single || large || tree—one || lots || branches—as || could || get || three || small || trees || choose || chooses || one || large || tree || carry || large || piece || wood || back || home || lugging || big || piece || wood || 40 || 50 || yards || hard || work || takes || lot || energy || course || make || one || trip || get || wood || back || water || hand || goes || three || small || trees || instead || take || less || energy || per || tree || get || wood || back || home || make || three || trips || back || forth || three || trees || presumably || often || wanders || home || likely || exposed || predators || better || single || large || tree || three || small || trees || another || critical || issue || related || first || size || issue || is… || far || water || go || get || trees || willing || travel || greater || distance || large || tree || since || get || much || wood || beavers || certainly || go || farther || water || get || aspen || tree || ash || tree || reflects || relative || values || size || travel || farther || larger || tree || smaller || tree || would || thought || bigger || tree || farther || beaver || would || willing || travel || make || sense || right || going || travel || far || make || trip || worth || bringing || back || wood || possible || actually || opposite || true || beavers || cut || large || trees || close || water || travel || far || cut || certain || small || trees || cut || quickly || drag || back || home || quickly || generally || farther || go || water || smaller || tree || cut || willing || make || trips || haul || back || less || wood || carries || greater || risk || exposed || predators || looks || though || beavers || less || interested || minimizing || exposure || predators || interested || saving || energy || foraging || wood || may || also || explain || beavers || forage || primarily || evenings || ok || behavior || indicate || concern || much || energy || expend || exposed || predators || one || believes || beaver || consciously || weighs || pros || cons || elements || answer || give || behavior || evolved || time || shaped || constraints || vast || stretches || time || comes || fact || best || foraging || strategy || beavers || one || yields || food || wood || one || results || descendants || offspring || let || discuss || idea || works || narrator || listen || part || lecture || art || history || class || male || professor || ok || um || sort || paradigmatic || art || form || middle || ages || stained || glass || art || stained || glass || course || simply ||

female || professor || last || 15 || years || many || american || cities || difficulty || maintaining || successful || retail || environment || business || owners || city || centers || downtown || areas || experienced || financial || losses || steady || movement || people || cities || suburbs || general || downtown || areas || n't || many || residential || areas || many || people || live || city || planners || decided || well || one || way || 've || come || ways || attract || people || shop || downtown || creating || pedestrian || malls || pedestrian || mall || 's || pretty || simple || concept || really || essentially || outdoor || shopping || area || designed || people || foot || and—uh || well || unlike || many || shopping || malls || built || suburbs || nowadays—these || pedestrian || malls || typically || located || downtown || area || city || well || features || like || listing || wide || sidewalks || comfortable || outdoor || seating || uh || maybe || even || fountains || know || art || variations || model || course || common || denominator || always || idea || creating || shopping || space || get || people || shop || city || without || needing || cars || sure || see || area || 's || off-limits || automobile || traffic || would || ideal || heavily || populated || city || well || streets || would || otherwise || bustling || noisy || unpleasant || traffic || congestion || concept || originated || europe || adopted || american || city || planners || late || 1950s || since || number || unites || states || cities || created || pedestrian || malls || many || highly || successful || city || planners || learned || making || malls || succeed || well || two || critical || factors || consider || creating || pedestrian || mall || location || design || equally || important || let || 's || start || location || choosing || specific || location || pedestrian || mall || fact || two || considerations || proximity || potential || customers || uh || would || call || customer || base || accessibility || public || transportation || get || moment || customer || base || obvious || example || would || large || office || building || since || employees || could || theoretically || go || shopping || work || lunch || hour || right || another || really || good || example || convention || center || typically || hotel || large || meeting || spaces || draw || visitors || city || major || business || conferences || events || ideally || pedestrian || malls || would || used || local || residents || people || working || city || visiting || area || 's || access || public || transportation || comes || either || um || either || designers || plan || locate || mall || near || central || transportation || hub—like || bus || terminal || major || train || subway || station || work || city || officials || create || sufficient || parking || areas || far || mall || make || sense || people || drive || mall || area || well || need || easy || access || ok || 's || location || design || well || design || n't || necessarily || include || things || like || sculptures || decorative || walkways || even || eye || catching || window || displays—you || know—art || although || 'd || first || admit || things || aesthetically || appealing || however || visually || pleasing || sights || well || part || pedestrian || mall || design || matter || key || consideration || compact || convenient || layout || one || allows || pedestrians || walk || one || end || mall || minutes || get || major || stores || restaurants || central || places || without || take || one || two || turns || takes || careful || creative || planning || one || ingredient || planning || recipe || missing || could || quite || possibly || long-lasting || effects || think || good || example || pedestrian || mall || louisville || kentucky || instance || louisville || mall || built || oh || lots || visual || appeal || attractively || designed || right || small || part || downtown || pretty || much || possessed || design || elements || success || point || location || comes || play || n't || convention || center || around || help || draw || visitors || well || nearby || hotel || eventually || closed || reason || well || imagine || must || affected || local || pedestrian || mall || business || owners || sort || call || chain || reaction || n't || convention || center || parking || garage || built || decade || later || mall || started || successful || narrator || listen || part || lecture || ecology || class || female || professor || continuing || discussion ||

weekend || see || apply || interdependence || idea || mike || male || student || well || um || beavers || ecosystems || beavers || waterways || female || professor || good || good || go || male || student || like— || launching || detailed || explanation || well || see || 's || important || cause || go || back || european || settled || north || america || like || 1600s || back || native || americans || people || living || here—well || back || lot || beavers || later || europeans || female || professor || cutting || ok || wait || see || heading || go || european || settlement || affected || ecosystem || tell || -- || kind || environment || beavers || live || think || like || europeans || settlers || came || breath || bit || 'll || come || back || headed || female || student || ok || well || beavers || live || near || streams || rivers… || block || streams || rivers || like || logs || sticks || mud || know || build || dams || really || slow || flow || stream || water || backs || creates || like || pond || floods || nearby || land || female || professor || creates || wetlands || ok || tell || female || student || well || wetlands || 's || like || standing || water || still || water || around || water || lot || cleaner || swiftly || flowing || water || dirt || settlement || stuff || chance || sink || bottom || female || professor || important || discussion || wetland || areas || support || lot || varieties || life || swiftly || flowing || water || example || varieties || fish || insects || lots || frog || species || species || rely || species || start || live || near || wetlands || female || student || yes || lightbulb || like || birds || mammals || eat || fish || insects || get || trees || plants || begin || grow || near || standing || water || ca || n't || grow || near || running || water || trail || end || clear || student || know || continue || oh || 's || something || wetland || groundwater || female || professor || ok || good || wetlands || big || effect || groundwater—the || amount || water || surface || land || think || wetlands || umm || like || giant || sponge || earth || soaks || lot || water || 's || continually || flooding || surface || increases || amount || water || wetland || get || lot || groundwater || groundwater || happens || big || source || drinking || water || today || alright || back || beavers || beavers || n't || male || student || regular || running || stream || cause || dam || ecosystem || would || completely || different—there || would || fewer || wetlands || female || professor || exactly || let || 's || go || back || headed || mike || mentioned || change || occurred || europeans || came || north || america || male || student || yeah—well || used || beavers || place || something || like || 200 || million || beavers || continental || united || states || europeans || came || started || hunting || beavers || fur… || cause || beaver || fur || really || warm—and || really || popular || making || hats || europe || beavers || hunted || lot || overhunted—they || almost || extinct || 1800s || so…that || meant || fewer || wetlands—less || standing || water || female || professor || mean || ecosystem || kate || female || student || well || less || standing || water || ecosystem || ca || n't || support || many || species || lot || insects || fish || frogs || ca || n't || live || running || water || birds || animals || eat || lose || foods || supply || female || professor || nodding || along || precisely || making || key || point || beaver || ecosystem || call || keystone || species || term || keystone || kind || explains || architecture || keystone || archway || doorway || stone || holds || whole || thing || together || keeps || collapsing || well || 's || keystone || species || ecosystem—it || crucial || species || keeps || system || going || beaver || populations || rise || something || think || consider || humans || part || ecosystems || 've || probably || heard || water || shortages || restrictions || much || water || use || especially || summer || time || recent || years || remember || said || groundwater || imagine || still || beavers || around || wetlands || would || water || supply || like || narrator || listen || conversation || student || language || lab || manager || male || student || hi || 'm || sure || err || carter || language || lab || female ||

terrestrial || rock || talk || meteorites || come || need || talk || comets || asteroids || basically || basically || made || debris || left || origin || solar || system || billion || years || ago || going || bit || order || um || going || go || depth || uh || comets || asteroids || come || back || later || 'll || cover || basic || info || ok || comets || asteroids… || might || help || think || of…remember || talked || two || classes || planets || solar || system || differ || composition || reviewing || terrestrial || planets || like || mars || earth…composed || largely || rocks || metals || large || gas || giants || like || jupiter || well || solar || system || also || two || analogous || classes || objects || smaller || planets…namely || asteroids || comets || relatively || near || sun || inner || solar || system || jupiter || mars || precise || 've || got || asteroid || belt || contains || 90 || asteroids || orbiting || sun || asteroids || uh || like || terrestrial || planets || composed || mostly || rocky || material || metals || far || sun || outer || solar || system || beyond || jupiter || 's || orbit || temperatures || low || enough || permit || ices || form || water ||

thousands || years || 've || analyzed || enough || learn || lot || composition || come || asteroids…though || may || come || comets…so || essentially || rocks || like || rocks || mixtures || minerals || generally || classified || three || broad || categories || stones || stony || irons || irons || stone || meteorites || refer || simply || uh || stones || almost || entirely || rock || material ||

|| seven || nine || times || total || life || others || like || skin || cells || divide || many || many || times || finally || cells || stop || renewing || die || cells || human || body || cells || every || organ || almost || every || type || tissue || body || thing || happen || eventually || ok || know || persons || genetic || information || contained || long || pieces || dna || called ||

|| like || well || actually || 's || much || complex || reminds || us || couple || springs || linked || together || two || coiled || pieces || dna || stretch || find || contain || certain || genes || certain || sequences || dna || help || determine || cells || body || develop || researchers || look || really || carefully || dna || chromosomes || though || amazed—we || were—to || find || fraction || maybe || 20 || 30 || percent || converts || meaningful || genetic || information || 's || incredible || least || you…if || took || away || dna || codes || genes || still || maybe || 70 || percent || dna || left || over…that || 's || so-called || junk || dna || though || word || junk || used || sort || tongue || cheek || assumption || even || dna || n't || make || genes || must || serve ||

|| energy || sources || move || 's || probably || well-known || alternative || energy || source || umm || solar || energy || sun || basically || provides || earth || virtually || unlimited || source || energy || every || day || problem || always || tap || source || energy || anyone || think || 's || difficult || make || use || solar || energy || female || student || 's || hard || um || gather || male || professor || 's || exactly || solar || energy || everywhere || 's || also || quite || diffused || thing || dream || solar || energy || new || one || humanity || trying || use || sun || 's || light || reliable || source || energy || centuries || around || beginning || 20th || century || actually || primitive || solar || water || heaters || consumer || market || sell || well || wan || na ||

economic || factors || 's || easy || see || 1970s || interest || solar || energy || think || happened || male || student || oil || natural || gas || err || became || scarce || male || professor || well || exactly || amount || oil || natural || gas || earth || still || plentiful || reasons || uhh || political || thing || really || gon || na || get || happened || 1970s || oil || natural || gas || became || expensive || quickly || spurred || people || start || looking || alternative || forms || energy—solar || energy || probably || popular || 80 || trend || reversed || price || oil || natural

even || though || may || difficult || understand || huge || massive || ice || move || flow || 's || another || word || it—it || really || secret || glaciers || flow || gravity || flow || way || flow || needs || explaining || first || type || glacier || flow || called || basal || slip || basal || slip—or || sliding || 's || often || called—basically || refers || slipping || sliding || glacier || across || bedrock—actually || across || thin || layer || water || top || bedrock || um || process || n't || hard || imagine || happens || ice || base || glacier || great || deal || pressure ||

allows || slide || pass || glacier || oozes || downhill || without || ice || actually || melting || couple || factors || affect || amount || deformation || takes || place || speed || glacier || 's ||

n't || paint || people || half-man-half-bison || creature || outlines || human || hands || depiction || full || human || precise || animals || birds || fish || snakes || religion || magic || sheer || beauty || n't || know || whatever || worth || spend || hours || deep || inside || cave || torch || utter || darkness || note || let || 's || dim || lights || see || slides || actually || look || techniques || used || narrator || listen || part || lecture || astronomy || class || male || professor || astronomy || n't || really || uh || bloom || science || today || development || spectroscopy || spectroscopy || basically || study || spectra || spectral || lines || light || specifically || us || light || stars || makes || possible || analyze || light || emitted || stars || analyze || light || figure || distance || earth || identify || made || of—determine || chemical || composition || get || though || probably || good || thing || back || bit || know || take || crystal || prism || pass || beam || sunlight || get || spectrum || looks || like || continuous || band || rainbow || colors || light || see || human || eyes || band || rainbow || color || falls || range || 's || called || visible || light || visible || light || spectroscopy || probably || important || kind || spectroscopy || anyone || wan || na || take || stab || scientific || term || visible || light… || 'm || sure || know || reading || today… || clearing || throat || indicating || sarcasm || female || student || confident || optical || radiation || hesitant || thought || exposed || radiation || 's || dangerous || male || professor || yes || 're || talking || radiation || like || element || uranium || yeah || 's || dangerous || radiation || general || term || actually || refers || anything || spreads || away || source || optical || radiation || visible || light || energy || spreading || ok || 've || got || spectrum || beam || sunlight || looks || like || colors || bleed || uh || interruptions || band || flowing || violet || green || yellow || to…you || get || idea || well || happens || sunlight || spectrum || magnified || pause || slightly || breath || maybe || n't || reading || well || 's || see || want || notice || spectrum || interrupted || dark || lines || called || spectral || lines || really || magnified || spectrum || sunlight || could || identify || hundred || thousand || 'em || may || look || kinda || randomly || placed || actually || form || many || distinct || patterns || looking || spectrum || star || colors || would || spectral || lines || would || break || different || places || making || different || patterns || pattern || stands || distinct || chemical || element || different || sets || patterns || spectral || lines || mean || star || different || chemical || composition || female || student || know || spectral || patterns || match || elements || male || professor || well || kind || spectroscopic || library || elements || compiled || using || flame || tests || known || element || uh || say || piece || iron || example || heated || pure || gas || flame || iron || eventually || heats || point || radiates || light || light || passed || prism || breaks || spectrum || unique || pattern || kind || like || chemical || fingerprint || spectral || lines || element || appears || process || repeated || many || different || elements || figure || chemical || makeup || another || star || comparing || spectral || pattern || pattern || elements || library || oh || interesting || story || one || elements || discovered || spectroscopy || pretty || extensive || library || spectral || line || patterns || elements || even || 1860 || british || astronomer || analyzing || spectrograph || sunlight || noticed || particular || pattern || spectral || lines || match || anything || library || put || two || two || together || decided || element || sun || n't || discovered || earth || yet || guesses || element || actually || turned || pretty || common || 'm || sure || know || pause || ok. || let || 's || try || something || else…any || happen || familiar || greek || word || sun || chance || male || student || something || like || helios || something || like || …oh || must || `` || helium || '' || 're || sayin || helium || discovered || sun || first || male || professor || yes || good || example || important || spectroscopy || astronomy || narrator || listen || conversation || student || professor || male || student || uh || excuse || professor || thompson || know || office || hours || tomorrow || wondering || minutes || free || discuss || something || female || professor || sure || john || want || talk || male || student || well || quick || questions || write || research || project || semester || climate || variations || female || professor || oh || yes || looking || variations || climate || grant || city || area || right || far || along || gotten || male || student || 've || got || data || 'm || starting || summarize || preparing || graphs || stuff || 'm || 'm || looking || 'm || afraid || 's || enough || 'm || sure || else || put || report || female || professor || hear || thing || every || student || know || remember || 're || expert || 've || done || think || 'd || need || include || going || explain || research || project || someone || general || casual || knowledge || subject || like || like || parents || 's || usually || rule || thumb || would || parents || understand || male || student || ok. || get || female || professor || hope || recognize || saying || much || know || subject || male || student || right || understand || wondering || also || include || notes || research || journal || suggested || keep || female || professor || yes || definitely || use || indicate || evolution || thought || time || set || know || purpose || try || understand || climate || variability || area || approach || male || student || ok. || example || studied || meteorological || records || looked || climate || charts || used || different || methods || analyzing || data || like || certain || statistical || tests || discussed || results || mean || female || professor || yes || 's || right || include || statistical || tests || especially || important || also || sure || include || good || reference || section || published || unpublished || data || came || 'cause || lot || unpublished || climate || data || male || student || hmm || something || came || mind || went || side || female || professor || oh || happens || lot || 've || come || pretty || good || memory || management || tool || carry || little || pad || time || jot || questions || ideas || n't || want || forget || example || went || doctor || daughter || baby || son || last || week || knew || would || n't || remember || everything || wanted || ask || doctor || actually || made || list || five || things || wanted || answers || male || student || notepad || good || idea || since || 'm || busy || end || semester || 'm || getting || pretty || forgetful || days || remembered || trying || say || female || professor || good || hoping || 'd || come || male || student || yes || ends || data || immediate || grant || city || area || also || included || regional || data || report || everything || else || pretty || good || indicator || climate || part || state || female || professor || sounds || good || 'd || happy || look || draft || version || hand || final || copy || wish || male || student || great || 'll || plan || get || draft || paper || next || friday || thanks || much || well || see || ya || female || professor || ok. || narrator ||

|| late || nineteenth || century || uh || basic || impressionist || style || different || earlier || styles || n't || depict || scenes || models || exactly || looked || uh || impressionist || painters || tended || apply || paint || really || thickly || big || brushstrokes || texture || canvas || rough || male || professor || good || else || subjects || male || student || well || lot ||

minerals || reindeer || need || um || reindeer || get || end || long || winter || often || thin || low || levels || minerals || spring || eat || different || plants || replenish || 've || lost || winter || reindeer || done || developed || ability || digest || different || plants || different || seasons || adjusting || microbes || digestive || systems || know || microbes || microorganisms || like || bacteria || help || digest || break || food || well || interesting || reindeer || change || proportion || different || microbes || digestive || system || uh || you…so || reindeer || might || one || kind || microbe || winter || help || digest || plants || eats || summer || uh || would || another || kind || microbe || help || digest || summer || plants || way || reindeer || gets || nutrition || different || foods || different || times || year || narrator || listen || part || lecture || geology || class || male || professor || ok || let || 's || get || started || great—today || want || talk || way || able || determine || old || piece || land || geologic || feature || dating || techniques || 'm || gon || na || talk || particular || dating || technique || good || dating || key || good || analysis || words || want || know || land || formation || formed || first || thing || probably || want || know || old || 's || fundamental || uh || take || grand || canyon || instance || geologists || thought || pretty || good || idea || grand || canyon || southwestern || united || states || formed || knew || formed || sandstone || solidified || somewhere || 150 || 300 || million || years || ago || solidified || regular || sand—essentially || part || vast || desert || recently || us || thought || sand || come || ancient || mountain || range || fairly || close || flattened || time || 's || conventional || wisdom || among || geologists || quite || time || 've || learned || something || different || quite || surprising || using || technique || called || uranium-lead || dating || say || uranium-lead || dating || around || quite || recent || refinements—i || 'll || get || minute || anyway || uranium-lead || dating || produced || surprises || two || geologists || discovered || half || sand || grand || canyon || actually || part || appalachian || mountains || 's || really || eye-opening || news || since || appalachian || mountain || range || course || thousands || kilometers || east || grand || canyon || sounds || pretty || unbelievable || right || course || obvious || question || sand || end || far || west || theory || huge || rivers || wind || carried || sand || west || mixed || sand || already || well || pretty || revolutionary || finding || uh || basically || uranium-lead || dating || pause || well || everyone || class || know || usually || look || grain || type || within || sandstone || meaning || actual || particles || sandstone || determine || came || things || like || look || wind || water || brought || grains || location || figure || way || flowing || 's || useful || point || 's || two || geologists || uranium-lead || dating || allowed || go || entirely || different || way || looked || grains || zircon || sandstone || zircon || material || contains || radioactive || uranium || makes || useful || dating || purposes || zircon || starts || molten || magma || hot || lava || volcanoes || magma || crystallizes || zircon || crystallizes || uranium || inside || begins || change || lead || measure || amount || lead || zircon || grain || figure || grain || formed || determine || age || zircon || different || mountain || ranges || compare || age || zircon || sandstone || sample || age || zircon || mountains || age || zircon || matches || age || one || mountain || ranges || means || sandstone || actually || used || part || particular || mountain || range || everybody || good || case || uranium-lead || dating || used || establish || half || sandstone || samples || formed || time || granite || appalachian || mountains || formed || new || way || uranium-lead || dating || 've || able || determine || one || major || assumptions || grand || canyon || wrong || like || said || uranium-lead || dating || us || um || recently || order || really || study || many || individual || grains || took || long || time || got || results || n't || efficient || n't || accurate || technical || advances || cut || number || grains || study || get || results || faster || 'll || predict || uranium-lead || dating || going || become || increasingly || popular || dating || method || pretty || exciting || possibilities || uranium-lead || dating || one || comes || mind || know || theory || earth || 's || continents || joined || together || split || apart || relatively || recently || well || uranium-lead || dating || prove || conclusively || show || evidence || joined || could || really || tell || us || lot || early || history || planet || 's || geology || narrator || listen || part || conversation || student || professor || female || professor || hi || mathew || 'm || glad || could || come || today || 've || observing || mr. || grabell || 's || third-grade || class || approaches || education || paper || right || male || student || um… || yes…i || go || johnson || elementary || school. || know || watch || mr. || grabell || teach || children || class || 's || amazing || mean || 'm || learning || much || watching || 'm || glad || classroom || observations || requirement || education || program || mean || 's || like || best || thing || ever || prepare || good || teacher || female || professor || well || 'm || glad || see || feel || way || mathew || know || 's || goal || reading || observation || notes || quite || interested || going || on—in || particular || astronomy || unit || teaching || male || student || questioning || sure || leading || astronomy || unit || female || professor || seems || mr. || grable || mastered || interdisciplinary || approach || teaching || 've || talking || class || male || student || oh || ok. || trying || think || example || yeah || like || teaching || astronomy || teach || names || planets || used || way || teach || mythology || female || professor || really || male || student || well || students || could || already || name || planets || n't || know || names || meaning || stories || behind || female || professor || leading || he…male || student || introduced || greek || roman ||

student || chose || planet || research || write || report || make || presentation || went || library || research || made || presentations || planet || chose || female || professor || one || science || unit || focus || astronomy || students || also || learned || literature || greek || roman || mythology || used || research || skills || library || wrote || report || practiced || oral || presentation || skills || male || student || exactly || used || one || topic || teach || third-graders || stuff || use || books || library || write || reports || even || speak || public || plus || great || time || female || professor || know || mathew || 've || talking || class || 'm || sure || everyone || could || learn || something || experience || pause || know || mathew || 'd || love || talk || astronomy || unit || class || wednesday || male || student || really || um || cuz || n't || really || think || 'll || time || write || paper || …female || professor || oh || wo || n't || need || write || anything || new || yet || wednesday || use || class || observation || notes || explain || things || 've || discussed || today || male || student || ok || sounds || right || narrator || listen || part ||

well || o'keeffe || really || painter || female || student || thought || photographer || mean || saw || one || photographs || museum || day || think || called || `` || red || leaves || white || '' || something || like || male || professor || oh—right || yes || large || dark || red || leaves || white || complete || title || 's || fairly || well-known || painting || o'keeffe || female || student || oh || oh || okay || thinking || guess || closer || look || male || professor || 's || really || good || observation || mean || chronologically || would || impossible || painting || color || film || even || invented || yet—neither || right || technology || blow || pictures || big || show || much || detail || painting || paintings || reveal || the-the || influence || photography || like || would || crop || images— || explaining || term || uh || would || make || frame || around || part || image—say || center—and || cut || certain || parts—the || parts || outside || frame || —to || create ||

flying || back || forth || also || parents || gon || na || away || nest || much || chicks || going || pretty || hungry || time || female || professor || ok || good || question || chicks || capable || going || long || periods || time || without || food || works || nicely || since || point || may || get || eat || often || far || parents || go || well || first || typically || ca || n't || get || enough || food || single || location || visit || several || places || foraging || trip || locations || good || foraging || grounds || tend || far || apart || uh || second || ca || n't || always ||

|| works || albatross || fly || using || technique || called || dynamic || soaring || enables || cover || long || distances || expending || little || energy || n't || 'd || right—they || would ||

female || student || know || get || food—i || mean || direction || take || get || food—and || find || way || back || home || female || professor || good || point || truth || sure || 's || difficult ||

|| get || cafeteria || female || professor || yeah || narrator || listen || conversation || student || professor || female || professor || mind || assigned || film || review || male || student || n't || female || professor || wrote || synopsis || detailed || summary || movie || 's || review || male || student || 's || guess || 'm || little || confused || cause || n't || film || review || know ||

|| many || people || seem || missed || point || think || may || forgo || evaluating || one || instead || maybe || 'll || devote || class || discussing || takes || write || good || film || review ||

|| works || like || power || plant || operate || decade || two || transferring || ownership || government || everyone || benefits || male || professor || yes || private || companies || make || profit || public || gets || needed || infrastructure || female || student || without || government || spend || money || front || amazing || male || professor || right || female || student || anyway || said || presentation || model || 's || used || turkey || right || said || handed || brochure || class || last || week—about || university || 's || global || enrichment || initiative || said || one ||

|| yeah || playwright || director || actors || people || work || together || produce || play || female || professor || yes || course || mee || means || historically || dramatic || literature || early || periods || hugely || influential || shaping || later || dramatic || works || male || student || like || playwright || bases || play || previous || playwright || theme || message || like || talking

right || jim || male || student || application || got || turned || um || 'm || sure || wonder || could || explain || female || program || manager || well || 'm || glad || came || jim || actually || quite || impressed || application || male || student || confused || ok. || female || program || manager || thing || run || music || station || talk || station || 've || music || station || since ||

air || keep || windows || doors || closed || trying || open || windows || people || laughs || gently || female || program || manager || tell || lot || passion || i-i || 'm || really || convinced || 's || good || idea || ok || first || thing || music || station || one || call-in || show || it-it || n't || fit || 're || studies || shown || mixed-format || stations || n't || successful || look || want || innovate || within || format || live || call-in || show || one || thing || idea || caller || going || say || idea || could || end || broadcasting || male || student || understand || seems || like || small || risk || take || exchange || giving || students || chance || talk || publicly || interactively || issues || care || really || think || 'd || like || place || air || views || current || events || university || female || program || manager || university || already || that- || 's || monthly || meeting || open || students || discuss || issues || like || ones || mentioned || application || several || student || clubs || campus || discuss || current || events || either || way || plans || change || format || innovative || idea || new || music || program || male || student || well || music || program || includes || taking || calls || listeners || female || program || manager || really || determined || call-in || show || huh || chuckles || male || student || well || 'm || communications || major || 'm || hoping || get || internship || professional || talk || radio || show || city || next || year || thought || little || experience || college || station || might || help || female || program || manager || 'll || tell || 's || still || time || application || deadline || n't || submit || new || application || music || show || idea || proposed || 'll || see || work || something || male || student || ok || thanks || narrator || listen || part || lecture || architecture || class || professor || discussing || housing || designs || male || professor || alright || last || class || began || discussion || housing || designs || united || states || 1940s || 'll || remember || example || looked || photos || discussed || apartment || complex || chicago || decade || today || let || 's || talk || housing || design || suburbs || demand || low-cost || housing || outside || cities || increased || late || 1940s || world || war || ii || whole || generation || young || families || needed || affordable || housing || firm || called || levitt || sons || strove || meet || demand || pretty || innovative || ways || designed || buildings || based || demands || public || much || artistic || vision || created || residential || community || state || new || york || became || known || levittown || levittown || first || suburb || kind || started || 2,000 || homes || called || cape || cod || houses-the || cape || cod || model- || designed || look || like || historical || cottages || new || england || states || northeastern || united || states || original || floor || plan || simple || living || room || front || house || windows || looking || towards || street || also || two || bedrooms || um || bathroom || kitchen || everything || one || floor || bathroom || right || next || kitchen || way || keeping || building || costs || since || two || rooms || could || rely || one || plumbing || system || another || feature || cape || cod || house || could || expanded || families || grew || needed || space || downstairs || stairs || house || actually || unfinished || attic || space || well || levitt || sons || promoted || houses || saying || attic || space || could || easily || converted || another || bedroom || even || two || always || possibility || building || additional || rooms || onto || house || later || house || built || way || materials-all || parts || standardized-so || houses || could || built || economically || important || meant || affordable || young || families || wanted || live || outside || city || result || whole || community || houses || except || color || roof || walls || hesitates || identical || eventually || 's || going || demand || variety || right || couple || years || levitt || sons || came || second || design- || doubtful || well || called || second || design || slightly || different || roof || plus || exterior || modern || look || model || called || ranch || house || 'm || guessing || n't || expensive || time || consuming || levitt || come || idea- || certainly || efficient || hugely || popular || families || ranch || like || cape || cod || except || living || room || back || house || instead || front || ranch || model || 's || one || important || feature || 's || present || cape || cod || large || window || living || room || called || picture || window || gives || kind || framed || view || outside || way || ranch || set || look || picture || window || living || room || 're || looking || back || house || instead || front || parents || could || watch || children || playing || back || yard- || grassy

|| school || really || seems || like || thing || 'd || looking || along || floor || plan || like || cape || cod || know || turned || 90 || degrees || levitt || sons || offered || ranch || houses ||

narrator || listen || part || lecture || biology || class || female || professor || okay || back || 1930s || biologist || named || g. || f. || gause || first || proposed || 's || known || gause || 's
